## 🚀 Project Scope & Timeline

This repository contains my personal contributions to a **4-week sprint** (April 28 – May 21, 2025)  
as part of a 5-person development team for BCIT's COMP 3800 capstone course.

We worked collaboratively using a shared Jira board to plan, track, and document all development work.  
The project was built on a **legacy codebase inherited from multiple previous teams**, requiring recovery and refactoring of deprecated features.
